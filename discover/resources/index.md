## <i class="fas fa-fw fa-plane"></i> Discover Server
{: .text-left}

Discover provides high-performance imagery and base maps services in WMS and WMTS formats. For information about the services and directions to sign up, please see the main [Discover]({% link discover/index.html %}) page.

- For imagery downloads visit the [aerial photography data page]({% link data/aerial-photography/index.html %}).

### Coordinate System and Datum
{: .text-left}

The native coordinate system for the Discover services is Web Mercator with a WGS 1984 datum (EPSG 3857). Many users work in coordinate systems with a different datum (for example, EPSG 3566: Utah Central with NAD 1983). Users who need the highest locational precision must use the appropriate [geographic transformation conversion]({% link downloads/Transformation.PNG %}) to remedy the roughly one meter difference between the WGS84 and NAD83 datums' “realization points.” AGRC uses the `NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_5` transformation when creating base map tiles and web applications, but **there may be more accurate transformations based on the data and area you are working with**. The default (no transformation specified) will likely introduce several feet of horizontal positional error. More information about these transformations can be found on ESRI's [NAD 1983 To WGS 1984](https://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/24159) How-To.

### Horizontal Positional Accuracy
{: .text-left}

Stated horizontal accuracy of the Google imagery is expected to achieve or exceed one meter (CE90) in most areas without significant vertical relief. You can generally expect higher precision in urban areas where existing supplemental ground control was more abundant.

The pre-2018 NAIP layers have a stated horizontal positional accuracy of 5 meters, while the 2018 NAIP products have a horizontal positional accuracy of 4 meters.

### Adding a WMTS or WMS Service to a Web Map
{: .text-left}

{%capture contact %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.discover text='send an email to' hide-punctuation=true %}{% endcapture %}

Interested in using AGRC's Web Mercator services in your web maps? Take a look at [this page]({{"/using-agrcs-new-web-mercator-services-in-your-web-maps/" | prepend:site.baseurl}}) for more information. **Remember, if the web map is going to be public facing you need to request a separate quad-work link**. To do this {{ contact }} and provide your web map URL domains.

### Adding a WMS Service to CAD
{: .text-left}

- **Bentley Microstation** users should take a look at the [How To document]({% link downloads/MicroStationGoogleWMS_HowTo.pdf %}).
- **AutoCAD Civil 3D** users should take a look at the [How To document](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad-map-3d/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/MAP3D-Use/files/GUID-A9F620AD-6B9A-487D-9B33-7D365307D571-htm.html).

### Adding a WMTS Service to QGIS
{: .text-left}

1. Add a new "WMS/WMTS" connection and paste in the URL to the discover WMTS service.

Read this [blog post]({% post_url 2015-01-20-how-to-use-agrc-base-maps-in-qgis %}) for more details.

### Printing Web Maps with Discover Services
{: .text-left}

Take a look at this blog post for information about [Printing Web Maps with Discover Services]({{"/printing-web-maps-with-discover-services/" | prepend:site.baseurl}}).

### Google Archive Services
{: .text-left}

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-lock"></i>
In addition to the statewide `Google` imagery service layer, there are archive layers available (ex. `Google 2011archive`) of the Google imagery organized by year collected.

### Google Flight Dates
{: .text-left}

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-lock"></i>
The dates of each Google imagery flight block can be downloaded as a [shapefile or geodatabase](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ByStJjVZ7c7mcWEzaXNRU09FUGM), viewed in [ArcGIS Online](https://arcg.is/1E0wq3b), or utilized through the `SGID10.INDICES.Google_UtahServiceDates` SGID layer.

### Pro/ArcMap User Considerations
{: .text-left}

{%capture contact2 %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.discover text='please contact' %}{% endcapture %}

Legacy username/password users: If you have not yet received quad-word links to the service (ex. `https://discover.agrc.utah.gov/login/path/your-unique-quad-word/`) that do not require a username and password, {{ contact2 }}

Users experiencing problems with the service, such as blurry tiles or different year vintages at different scales, may need to clear their local cache:

- **ArcMap** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient as this could take several minutes. If the blurry tiles persist you have the options to `Clear cache when the session ends` or `Don't cache any data locally`. Another option is to completely clear your ArcMap cache by going to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

- **ArcGIS Pro** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Cache`. You can also clear your entire Pro cache by going to the Pro project's `Options -> Display` and check `Clear cache` and selecting `OK`.

**ArcMap 10 and 10.1 users** should use WMS instead of WMTS. ArcMap 10 and below do not support WMTS, and ArcMap 10.1 [has issues](https://community.esri.com/thread/58788) rendering WMTS data.

### Usage Tracking
{: .text-left}

Individual organizations will be provided URL links for the Discover services that are unique to their organization. This will allow us to track general usage metrics and monitor the performance of the services. Do not distribute your URL links outside of your organization or division.

### Google Logos
{: .text-left}

<i class="fas fa-fw fa-lock"></i>
Our license with Google requires you to put the appropriate logo on any products made using the Google imagery.

### Requests for On-Premise Use
{: .text-left}

{%capture contact3 %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.discover text='Please provide the following information to' hide-punctuation=true %}{% endcapture %}

You may request a local copy of the NAIP, HRO, and Google imagery for off-line consumption when the provided imagery service does not meet your needs. {{ contact3 }} for consideration:

- Name & organization:
- Reason for request:
- Working on behalf of:
- Project names:
- Project locations:

### Other Tidbits
{: .text-left}

- We suggest that you occasionally refresh the connection to the imagery services by right-clicking your service connection in ArcCatalog or ArcMap's Catalog Viewer and selecting the `Refresh` button to see the latest list of available services.
- Since the Google acquisition flight blocks are not done all at once (as opposed to the NAIP products, which cover the whole state for every acquisition), there will be distinct color and positional changes at flight block boundaries. For large area maps, the color-balanced NAIP may be a more aesthetically pleasing cartographic choice.
- A tile index of the original .jp2 images that make up the Google imagery services is available from the SGID as SGID10.INDICES.Google_Tiles or as a [download from our ftp](ftp://ftp.agrc.utah.gov/UtahSGID_Vector/UTM12_NAD83/INDICES/UnpackagedData/Google_Tiles/_Statewide/).
- For future imagery updates, we can certainly pass along requests to Google for additional update areas or for specific collection periods. However, there is no provision in the current contract to create any expectation that those requests will be acted upon.
- AGRC has downloaded a statewide master set of the image files for redistribution, as the download process directly from Google incurs transactional costs for cloud server & bandwidth usage.
- AGRC has a [feedback reporting form](https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/forms/d/1UGU77SPM_HX0r8zblIs05C-H5mLyRja1gRT7Fu4aKZk/viewform?fbzx=-6743712545663240221) for imagery users around the state to report imagery and service issues so they can be passed along to Google. Please submit your feedback through this form.
