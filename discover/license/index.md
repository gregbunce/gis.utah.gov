### Background
{: .text-left}

At the beginning of 2015, a coalition of state, regional, and local government agencies purchased a license to Google's high resolution (6 inch pixels) aerial photography (_read the original post about the [acquisition]({% post_url 2015-02-02-utah-acquires-high-resolution-aerial-photography-license %})_). This license allows **Utah's cities, counties, special districts, state agencies, K12/Higher ed, and tribes** to use the imagery in web and desktop mapping applications through a streaming web service or, where needed, on-premise from locally-stored files. The license also allows **use by contractors and formal partners of the immediate licensees**.

The imagery is hosted in Google's cloud and delivered as WMS and WTMS Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) services via AGRC's **[Discover]({% link discover/index.html %})** basemap and imagery server. The original `.jp2` imagery tiles can be downloaded or obtained from AGRC, which keeps a master set of the imagery files.

### Who Qualifies?
{: .text-left}

- Utah state agencies
- Cities, counties, and other political subdivisions of the state of Utah
- Special districts (water, fire, etc) in the state of Utah
- Utah K-12 schools and institutions of higher education, including students working on school projects
- Tribal entities
- Contractors and formal partners of an immediate licensee
- Utah National Guard

### Who Doesn't Automatically Qualify?

- Federal agencies
- US Military
- Cities, counties, or state agencies outside of the state of Utah
- Out-of-state schools
- Non-profit entities
- Professional groups and organizations
- Community groups
- Private individuals
- Consultants and contractors

**Note**: Federal agencies, US military entities, consultants, contractors, or other formal partners **can qualify** if they are directly performing work on behalf of a qaulified licensee, but only for the specific project in the contract.

**_If you don't qualify for the Google imagery, you can sign up for Discover's general access services, which include NAIP imagery and the slightly older HRO imagery._**
