      <td>The Utah statewide Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) is a decision support and planning tool for beaver management. The backbone to BRAT is a capacity model developed to assess the upper limits of riverscapes to support beaver dam-building
        activities. Both existing and potential capacity were estimated with readily available spatial datasets to evaluate five key lines of evidence: 1) a perennial water source, 2) availability of dam building materials, 3) ability to build a dam
        at baseflow, 4) likelihood of dams to withstand a typical flood, and 5) likelihood that stream gradient would limit or completely eliminate dam building by beaver. Fuzzy inference systems were used to combine these lines of evidence while accounting
        for uncertainty.</td>
