abstract="Adding a geographic point for an address is a fundamental GIS task. To handle this task, AGRC has created many services and tools to cater to the wide geocoding user base. Starting from the ground up, AGRC helps maintain statewide address points and roads datasets. These two datasets are the foundation for geocoding. Building on top of the reference data, AGRC creates and maintains ArcGIS Locators. Locators are where most of the magic happens - taking the input data and finding a location from the reference data. These locators are available for download on this page. With the reference data and the locators blocks in place, AGRC can put together geocoding systems and tools. The AGRC WebAPI is a web service that can geocode over the web via http. Users can send requests via their favorite programming language, application, or web browser. This service has some magic to get the best results out of user input and is the recommended way to geocode addresses. AGRC also provides an ArcMap Geoprocessing tool and a Google spreadsheet geocoding tool that access the WebAPI. AGRC hopes to have the data and tools ready for your needs to geocode." %}

    <p><i class="fab fa-4x fa-mixcloud fa-pull-left"></i> The AGRC WebAPI is a C# .NET WebAPI project. This API can be accessed programmatically, over http (with standard get requests), without the use of GIS-specific software - such as a web application. This geocoding API uses 'front end' logic to resolve several common address standardization issues above and beyond what out-of-the-box geocoders handle. To get started, <a href="https://developer.mapserv.utah.gov/StartupGuide">read the getting started guide</a>. There are also examples of geocoding in <a href="https://github.com/agrc/GeocodingSample">multiple programming languages</a>.</p>

    <p><i class="fas fa-4x fa-archive fa-pull-left"></i>This custom toolbox created by the AGRC that allows ArcGIS users to geocode a table of addresses. The geocoding tool makes use of the AGRC API and will produce as output a <code>.csv</code> file with the input unique identifier field, the input address information, and the match results. It also produces a file geodatabase table with the same information and will automatically add the table to the current project when run from ArcMap. A user can use the table to join on the unique record identifier to connect with the original results, and also to <code>Display XYEvents</code> to create a map layer of the results.</p>

    <p>AGRC_RoadsLocator is an ArcGIS 10 address locator that references the statewide Transportation.Roads feature class and uses the right and left zip code fields and/or the right and left address systems fields for zone. This address locator is built using an alternate names table, as recommeded in NextGen 911 model. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as both Highway 68 and 1700 West.

    <div class="pop">Locator Packages are not supported in ArcGIS 10.0 or earlier</div>
    <h5>Usage</h5>
    <p>The <code>.gcpk</code> packages are portable files that do not require the reference data: what is required of the data is included in the packaged. Once downloaded, <code>Unpack</code> the package and it is ready for use. You can <code>Unpack</code> the Locator Package in ArcCatalog by right-clicking on the package. Unpacking will always place the unpacked locator in your user profile <code>..\My Documents\ArcGIS\Packages</code>. Alternatly, you can use ESRI's <code>Extract Package</code> tool and specify an output location. You can also drag the <code>.gcpk</code> file into ArcMap and it will unpack automatically.</p>
