    <p>The Utah NG911 GIS Database contains datasets conforming to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) standards for the NG9-1-1 Data Model. In addition to the required Road Centerlines, Address Points, PSAP Boundary, Law Enforcement, Fire, and Emergency Medical Service datasets, the database also contains many of the recommended datasets including: Cell Towers, Counties, Hydrology Line, Streams, Lakes, Incorporated Municipalities, Mile Markers, Railroads, States, and Unincorporated Communities.  This database also contains the recommended Road Centerlines’ Alias Names table and the Address Points’ Landmark Names Alias tables.</p>
    <p>At first, AGRC will update the Utah NG911 GIS Database on a monthly cycle - in conjunction with our <a href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">road update cycle</a>. However, updates will become more frequent when AGRC finalizes a mechanism to receive direct edits from the authoritative data editors (ex: PSAPs, jurisdictions, sheriff’s office, etc.).  This mechanism will ensure up-to-date, accurate data that AGRC will push into the Utah NG911 GIS Database. Updates to this NG911 database will become much more frequent when that mechanism becomes operational. It is our goal to keep these datasets as up-to-date and accurate as possible.</p>
