    <p>Demographic.PopBlockAreas2010_Approx contains areas of census blocks that only represent populated areas. This dataset was created by AGRC using the original 2010 census blocks. The blocks were cut when necessary to only cover residential areas. This was done using aerial imagery and is an approximation.</p>

    <p>Demographic.UrbanAreasCensus2010 represents Census Bureau delineated urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the "urban footprint." There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.</p>
