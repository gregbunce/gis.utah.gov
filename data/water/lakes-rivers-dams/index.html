abstract="The Lakes, Rivers, Streams & Springs data package contains feature layers that are derived from the <a href='https://nhd.usgs.gov/data.html'>National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)</a>. The NHD is the surface water component of the National Map created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The NHD contains a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. NHD data in it's entirety can be downloaded from <a href='ftp://nhdftp.usgs.gov/DataSets/Staged/States/FileGDB/HighResolution/'>here</a> (ex. NHDH_UT_). </p><p>The USGS has <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/news/nhd-and-wbd-map-services-moving-cloud'>web-based map services</a> of the NHD and WBD. You are also able to view the USGS services on <a href='https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/'>ArcGIS Server</a> or connect to their server with <code>https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services</code>.</p>" %}

    <p>Water.LakesNHDHighRes is the recommended data layer for depicting Utah's lakes, reservoirs, and smaller features, etc. This data is derived from the National Hydrology Database (NHD) compiled by the UGSS in partnership with AGRC and other states' GIS programs. The derivation and modification process has been performed by AGRC to provide a general purpose feature class of water bodies. Two fields have been added to this feature class (InUtah and IsMajor) and features have been split at the state boundary.</p>

      <li><code>FCODE</code> can be used to classify water body features by functional type.

    <ul class="dotless">

    <ul class="dotless">
      <li><code>FCODE</code> can be used to classify water course features by functional type.
      <li><code>FNAME</code> is the name of the water course

    <ul class="dotless">
      <li><code>ISMAJOR</code> can be used to query only the major water courses for coarse scale mapping
      <li><code>ISSUBMERGED</code> can be used to exclude the hydrologic network features that have been added across water bodies to the NHD dataset for linear water flow modeling
