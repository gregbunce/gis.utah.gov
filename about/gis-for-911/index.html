(1) Subject to annual legislative appropriation from the fund to: (c) the state's Automated Geographic Reference Center in the Division of Information Technology Services, an amount equal to 1 cent per month levied on telephone services under Section 69-2-5.6 shall be used to enhance and upgrade statewide digital mapping standards.</em></p>

<p>Additionally, State law specifies that the State Geographic Information Database (SGID), managed by AGRC, is the central clearinghouse for geospatial data. The SGID  includes road centerline, address data, boundary, ownership, aerial photography, and base map services that are utilized by local, state, federal, and tribal agencies across Utah.</p>
<p>AGRC provides coordination, data integration, and quality assurance to bring local data together and make it functional as a statewide map data layer. Additionally, AGRC staff have provided technical assistance to local PSAPs and jurisdictions in support of improved data resources and technical expertise.</p>
<p>AGRC also participates in the Utah 911 Committee's monthly meetings and stays abreast to GIS-related activities that involve or impact the Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) throughout the state.
